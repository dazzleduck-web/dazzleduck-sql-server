<br> Flight Sql Server/ Http Sql Server with DuckDB backend lets you run DuckDB remotely and let multiple user connect to it remotely with flight jdbc driver or over Http using arrow extension.
<br> It support all the clients including JDBC, ADBC Python flight sql driver as well as sqlflite_client CLI tool

## Dev Setup
Requirement
JDK  21

## Getting started with Docker
- Build the docker image.
  `./mvnw clean package -DskipTests jib:dockerBuild`
- Start the container with `example/data` mounted to the container
  ``` 
  docker run -ti -v "$PWD/example/data":/local-data -p 59307:59307 -p 8080:8080 dazzleduck-sql --conf useEncryption=false --conf warehouse=/data/warehouse
  Warehouse Path :/data/warehouse
  Http Server is up: Listening on URL: http://localhost:8080
  Flight Server is up: Listening on URI: grpc+tcp://0.0.0.0:59307
  ```
- The server is running in arrow flight sql and http mode

### Supported functionality
1. Database and schema specified as part of connection url. Passed to server as header database and schema.
2. Fetch size can be specified. It's passed to the server in header fetch_size.
3. Bulk write to parquet file using bulk upload functionality. Idea is to bulk upload and then add those files to metadata.
4. Username and Passwords can be specified in application.conf file.

## Connecting to HTTP server.

The server is running on HTTP mode on port 8080 which can used to query DuckDB with POST and GET methods. This will return data in arrow format.<p>
The return data can itself be queried with duckdb
- Using HTTP GET to query the server and read the data in duckdb
  ```
  URL="http://localhost:8080/query?q=select%201"
  SQL="INSTALL arrow FROM community; LOAD arrow; FROM read_arrow('/dev/stdin') SELECT count(*);"
  curl -s "$URL" | duckdb -c "$SQL"
  ```
- Using http post

- Writing to Server using post <br>
```
curl -i -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/ingest?path=file1.parquet' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream" \
  --data-binary "@dazzleduck-sql-http/example/arrow_ipc/file1.arrow"
```
- Reading the file written above <br>
```
URL="http://localhost:8080/query?q=select%20%2A%20from%20read_parquet%28%27%2Fdata%2Fwarehouse%2Ffile.parquet%27%29%0A"
curl -s "$URL" | duckdb -c "$SQL"
```

## Connecting to Remote HTTP server with Local DuckDB
```
D INSTALL arrow FROM community;
D LOAD arrow;
D SELECT * FROM read_arrow(concat('http://localhost:8080/query?q=', url_encode('select 1, 2, 3')));
```


## Connecting to the flight server via Flight JDBC
Download the [Apache Arrow Flight SQL JDBC driver](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:flight-sql-jdbc-driver)

You can then use the JDBC driver to connect from your host computer to the locally running Docker Flight SQL server with this JDBC string (change the password value to match the value specified for the SQLFLITE_PASSWORD environment variable if you changed it from the example above):
```bash
jdbc:arrow-flight-sql://localhost:59307?database=memory&useEncryption=0&user=admin&password=admin
```

For instructions on setting up the JDBC driver in popular Database IDE tool: [DBeaver Community Edition](https://dbeaver.io) - see this [repo](https://github.com/voltrondata/setup-arrow-jdbc-driver-in-dbeaver).

**Note** - if you stop/restart the Flight SQL Docker container, and attempt to connect via JDBC with the same password - you could get error: "Invalid bearer token provided. Detail: Unauthenticated".  This is because the client JDBC driver caches the bearer token signed with the previous instance's secret key.  Just change the password in the new container by changing the "SQLFLITE_PASSWORD" env var setting - and then use that to connect via JDBC.

## Connecting to the flight server via the new [ADBC Python Flight SQL driver](https://pypi.org/project/adbc-driver-flightsql/)

You can now use the new Apache Arrow Python ADBC Flight SQL driver to query the Flight SQL server.  ADBC offers performance advantages over JDBC - because it minimizes serialization/deserialization, and data stays in columnar format at all phases.

You can learn more about ADBC and Flight SQL [here](https://voltrondata.com/resources/simplifying-database-connectivity-with-arrow-flight-sql-and-adbc).

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed, then open a terminal, then run:
```bash
# Create a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
. .venv/bin/activate

# Install the requirements including the new Arrow ADBC Flight SQL driver
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas pyarrow adbc_driver_flightsql

# Start the python interactive shell
python
```

In the Python shell - you can then run:
```python
import os
from adbc_driver_flightsql import dbapi as sqlflite, DatabaseOptions


with sqlflite.connect(uri="grpc+tls://localhost:59307",
                        db_kwargs={"username": os.getenv("SQLFLITE_USERNAME", "admin"),
                                   "password": os.getenv("SQLFLITE_PASSWORD", "admin"),
                                   DatabaseOptions.TLS_SKIP_VERIFY.value: "true"  # Not needed if you use a trusted CA-signed TLS cert
                                   }
                        ) as conn:
   with conn.cursor() as cur:
       cur.execute("select * from generate_series(20)",
                   )
       x = cur.fetch_arrow_table()
       print(x)
```

You should see results:


## Connecting via [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org)

## Connecting via [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org)

## Enabling Authentication in HTTP Mode.
Authentication is supported with jwt. Client need to invoke login api with username/password this api would return jwt  token. This jwt token can be used for all subsequent invocation
- Run the server with authentication enabled 
  `docker run -ti -v "$PWD/example/data":/local-data -p 59307:59307 -p 8080:8080 flight-sql-duckdb --conf useEncryption=false --conf warehouse=/data/warehouse --conf http.authentication=jwt`
- Get the jwt token with login <br>
 ```curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/login' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "admin", "password" : "admin"}'```
- Invoke api with jwt token
```
URL="http://localhost:8080/query?q=select%201"
curl -H "Authorization': 'Bearer <jwt-token>" -s "$URL"
```
- Run the query with jwt token by setting <br>
```
INSTALL arrow FROM community; LOAD arrow;
CREATE SECRET http_auth (
              TYPE http,
              EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS MAP {
                 'Authorization': 'Bearer <jwt-token>'
                 }
              );
SELECT * FROM read_arrow(concat('http://localhost:8080/query?q=', url_encode('select 1, 2, 3')));
```
